# Passphrase-Generator

This program uses RNGCryptoServiceProvider and Windows Forms (very crude and simple) to generate a passphrase easy to memorize but with very high entropy. 
This project was inspired by the https://theworld.com/~reinhold/diceware.html proposal.

To do:
- Capitalization Checkmark
- Numbers and special characters checkmark
